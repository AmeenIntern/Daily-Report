## Day 5

First day of the  week, The day begined with Sriram Anna's' Morning session, Devoloping Employee App. This time Joel also joined us. We started from where we lefted on last friday. Now we made more changes to the Employee login page like, We alligned the Heading part and welcome message. Given colors to Username and Password feilds, Given animation to Login button, Changed background color for the page as well.

I learned about Firebase, Its a google platform that helps you to quickly devolope high quality apps, Which having many options like Authentication, Database, analytics, In app chat message etc. We used its Authentication service to add Username and password, Where we added a normal E-mail sigin anda google account sign-in as well. That took some extra time. We didnt finish the whole thing but I abled to clear some of my doubts like, Why shouldnt we use wix like Devoloping sites for creating a page. 

I thought it may save us lot of time by, just searching a basic structure of a login page and then editing on it. But there we cant devolope according to our needs. And devoloping from scratch gives you the whole control of the program. Lesson learned *not always go for easy path*.

Finishing of with the session, I was assigned to do a study more about Firebase. I did browse through their site, which were filled all the function and services they provide. Its like a toolkit for devolopers. A real time saver.

I didnt forget about my break-down for Reumbursement app as well. I did a lot of researches like which data base we should use and I thought of using cloud database. I did a study on cloud database and other as well. But Im still in a confused state of thinking which to use. NoSQl is the type of database that showing in internet. But i have to ask with Joel about that. Its a bit confusing on what to choose and how to choose.

After then we had a Meeting with the team. Yeah monday is the meeting day. This time Rexelia conducted the meeting, Every one explained on whats their focus for this week. I wroted down all the points. After the meeting over I continued my research on database and authentication because Joel bro told me to get it done by Wednesday. On wednesday there will be a presentation which me and joel will be doing together. So i should make sure on my part of work. 

Soon after the lunch, we had a intern session with Abraham anna. It was a quick session which lasted 10minutes. He taught us about markdown files.
Where in mark down files we can able to give styles for text like, giving a heading, making words bold, italic. Given list, nested list etc.
and remind us to get familiar with vim and start doing our daily reports on .md file.

After the session over i started doing Meeting Report in .md file by giving all the text styles. I abled to write but I coudnt able to get a preview of my meeting report because md file should be opened in a different platform. Which i didnt knew, I was keep on triying it in text editor. Then i got some help with others and tried to open in a online md file viewer. But that too failed. Then Askin bro told me that a md file can be opened in Git.

With a help from Anoop bro, I started creating an account in  Github. I didnt even knew for what Github is used. Anoop helped me to understand how Github wroks and How in office people send files to other. 

Yeah, created an account uplaoded my .md file and here it was abled to see a preview of how my report was. Did some editing here and there.

Yeah,  This day too went well.
